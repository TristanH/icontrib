# iContrib

Raise money and contribute to worthy causes -- all through twitter!

Donating to worthy causes is not inherently social... right now no matter how you contribute (private donation, kickstarter, indiegogo), payment is a HASSLE for the user and letting your friends know you donated is an AFTERTHOUGHT. The idea behind iContrib is that contribution to worthy causes should be frictionless as possible (what's easier than writing a tweet?) and everyone should know you donated be default. 

With iContrib, you donate to a cause by simply writing a tweet: "@IWillContribute $5 to #buildASchool".
